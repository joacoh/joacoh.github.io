Academic talk presented at the I Congreso Latinoamericano de Astronomía Extragaláctica (CLASTROEx) presenting how outflows are studied in edge-on galaxies, showing the example of ESO484-G036, a nearby starburst galaxy. Here I present analysis of the cold and ionised phases of the outflow using ALMA and VLT/MUSE data. This talk is in Spanish as it was intended to be understood by undergraduate students across Latinamerica.
